used these to create       MCSpectraInputPbPb_Stephan_it0.root  

ran train over LHC20g10 with datafits from it0

now have new  afterburner   MBwoPtWAddedSigWptw_newDataTrain_mixedMesonAmp: 
changes since last afterburner newCutNewSplinesWPCWFlexCock: 
 - new data train with Multiplicity task running
 - changed fit parameters in Afterburner, (see effects in CutStudies/.../MixedMesonAmplitudeMin)
 - used AddedSignals MC
effects of all changes since last fits were done can be seen in:  CutStudies/.../NewSinceLastFitsForPtWeigths

MCROOTFILEADDSIGETA = /2023-_analysis/trains/2023-10-26_ASww/mc/GammaConvV1_996_eta.root

goal:
- make new fits which will be different because MC efficiency changed because of AddedSigMC and data changed
=> resulting weights file: MCSpectraInputPbPb_Stephan_it0b.root

ran over LHC24a1(only 30-50%) and LHC24a2 with _it0b.root in order to produce _it1.root with the following sources:

DATAROOTFILE=/2023-_analysis/trains/2023-11-05_dataReWithMultTask/data/GammaConvV1_993_wTPCPC_qr_merged.root 	=> unchanged
MCROOTFILE=/2023-_analysis/trains/2023-11-30_mc_ptw_0b/ab/GCo_994.root					        => new
MCROOTFILEADDSIG=/trains/2024-06-25_invPtW_all-AS-MCs/2099-2101_merged/GCo_997.root				=> new
MCROOTFILEADDSIGETA=/trains/2024-06-25_invPtW_all-AS-MCs/2099-2101_merged/GCo_998.root				=> new

 My proposed MC request  would bring the rel. stat. unc. of the MC true efficiency down to 1.3% and less .. for all the bins above 2 GeV. Between 1 and 2 GeV we would end up somewhere between 1.3-2%  

(the efficiency rises from ~1e-4 to 5e-4 but in this ptRange and also we have a lot of statistics in the existing Gen Purpose productions. I attach again the slide that shows the current situation. If it helps I can make a plot that shows, how the uncertainties would look with my request taken into account?
